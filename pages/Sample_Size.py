    st.markdown("""
    #### What is Sample Size? üë•
    **Sample size** is the number of users in each group of your test. Think of it like the lens on a camera you're using to see which variant is better. A bigger sample size gives you a bigger, more powerful lens.

    This bigger lens makes your test more sensitive in two key ways:

    1.  **You can spot smaller improvements (Lower MDE üîé)**
        A powerful camera lens (**more users**) can spot a tiny, faint star that a weaker lens would miss. Similarly, a larger sample size allows you to reliably detect a very **small uplift (a lower MDE)**.

    2.  **You're more certain about what you see (Higher Power üí™)**
        When you're trying to photograph a specific star, a bigger lens (**more users**) gives you a much better chance (**higher power**) of capturing a sharp, undeniable photo instead of a blurry, inconclusive smudge.

    The goal is to find the right balance‚Äîa lens big enough to be confident in the result, but not so big that you waste time and resources.

    ---
    #### What is Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)? üîé
    The **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)** is the smallest improvement your test can reliably detect at a given power level.

    Think of it as the sensitivity of your experiment. If the true uplift from your change is smaller than the MDE, your test will likely miss it. This doesn't mean the uplift isn't real, just that your experiment isn't powerful enough to see it. Use the MDE to set realistic expectations for what your test can achieve with your available traffic.

    ---
    #### What is Bayesian Power? üí™
    **Power** answers one critical question: *"If my variant is truly better by a specific amount, what's the probability my test will actually detect it?"*

    For example, 80% power means you have an 80% chance of getting a conclusive result (e.g., P(B > A) > 95%) if the real improvement matches what you expected. Running a test with low power is like trying to read in a dim room‚Äîyou're likely to miss things and end up with an inconclusive result, wasting valuable traffic.

    ---
    #### What are Priors? üß†
    **Priors** represent what you believe about the conversion rate *before* the test begins. In this model, your belief is captured by two numbers:
    - **Alpha ($$\\alpha$$)**: The number of prior "successes".
    - **Beta ($$\\beta$$)**: The number of prior "failures".

    * **No strong belief?** Use an **uninformative prior** like `alpha = 1` and `beta = 1`. This treats all possible conversion rates as equally likely to start.
    * **Have historical data?** Create an **informative prior**. If past data showed 50 conversions from 1,000 users, you'd set `alpha = 50` and `beta = 950`.

    As your test collects new data, the evidence from the experiment will quickly outweigh the initial prior belief.
